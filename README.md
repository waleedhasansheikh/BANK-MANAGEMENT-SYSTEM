# BANK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Explanation of C++ Bank Management System Code
Overview
The provided C++ code implements a simple bank management system through the BankAccount class. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and track the total number of accounts. The code exemplifies basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and the use of static members.

Key Components
Header Files and Namespace:

The program begins by including necessary header files: <iostream> for input and output operations, and <string> for managing strings.
The using namespace std; directive allows the use of standard library features without prefixing them with std::, making the code cleaner.
Class Definition:

The BankAccount class encapsulates all attributes and behaviors associated with a bank account. It contains:
Private Attributes:
static int totalAccounts: A static variable that tracks the total number of accounts created. Being static means it is shared among all instances of the class.
int accountNumber: A unique identifier for each account.
string accountHolder: The name of the account holder.
double balance: The current balance in the account.
Public Member Functions:
Constructor: Initializes the account holderâ€™s name, sets the initial balance to zero, and increments the total account count to assign a unique account number.
Deposit Method: Allows the user to add funds to their account, provided the deposit amount is positive.
Withdraw Method: Enables the user to withdraw funds, ensuring that the withdrawal amount is valid and does not exceed the current balance.
Check Balance Method: Returns the current balance of the account.
Get Account Number Method: Retrieves the account number for identification.
Get Total Accounts Method: Returns the total number of accounts created.
Static Variable Initialization:

cpp
Copy code
int BankAccount::totalAccounts = 0;
The static variable totalAccounts is initialized to zero, ensuring it starts from a known state.
Menu Display Function:

displayMenu() provides a user interface, listing the available operations the user can perform within the banking system.
Main Function Logic:

The main() function demonstrates the creation of three initial accounts for Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The program operates within a continuous loop to present the menu until the user chooses to exit.
A switch statement processes user input, allowing operations like depositing, withdrawing, checking balances, and displaying the total number of accounts.
Account creation is handled within the switch-case structure but lacks the functionality to store the newly created accounts, making it less practical for real-world scenarios.
Code Limitations and Improvements
Account Storage:

Currently, the implementation creates new accounts but does not store them in a manageable way. Implementing a data structure, such as an array or std::vector, would allow users to create multiple accounts and interact with them dynamically.
Total Accounts Functionality:

The getTotalAccounts() method should be declared static since it accesses the static variable totalAccounts. This would enhance clarity and correctness, as it reflects the nature of static members.
Error Handling:

While the code checks for invalid deposits and withdrawals, further validation for user input (e.g., ensuring the input is numeric) could improve robustness.
Dynamic Account Management:

The system can be enhanced to allow operations on any account, not limited to Alice. This could involve prompting the user to enter an account number for transactions.
Conclusion
This code serves as an educational tool for understanding OOP concepts such as encapsulation and the use of static variables. It provides a solid foundation for building more complex systems and encourages further exploration into account management, data structures, and user input validation.
